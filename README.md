# Overview

Not Go-ing Anywhere is a set of vulnerable Golang programs meant to show common vulnerabilities and provide a test bed for users to find, fix, and remediate Golang vulnerabilities.

It is modeled on our [not so smart contracts](https://github.com/crytic/not-so-smart-contracts) repository, and includes a mix of two types of programs:

- a wholistic ecosystem of vulnerablities using gRPC, Web, and `database/sql` and
- a set of focused programs meant to demo common Golang issues we see
